# Chapman Pharmacy School Quiz Application

> A highly flexible and robust quiz app that will allow faculty to have students compete against each one another to answer quiz questions. There is only a set number of seconds allowed to answer the question and the person who answers the question correctly first, gets more points. The faster they answer correctly, the more points they get.

> The gamification of the learning process will not only allow for a new method of assessing student learning, but it will also take advantage of the inherent competitive nature of students.
